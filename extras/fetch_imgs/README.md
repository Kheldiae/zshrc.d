# Zsh config icons

Small disclaimer : most of these icons in there are made by me using Inkscape, BUT not all of them. The list below aims to sort these and give proper credit to their makers, provided I can know who the hell they are...

By default, only question marks will be used, until I can know who is behind the used icon.
